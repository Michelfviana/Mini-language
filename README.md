# Mini Programming Language: Goals and Target Audience

## General Objective

Develop a mini programming language that is simple to learn and use, while still incorporating fundamental concepts from modern programming languages.

## Target Audience

- Programming beginners
- People interested in understanding basic programming language concepts
- Teachers who want to demonstrate fundamental programming language concepts

## Specific Objectives

1. **Simplicity**: The language should be easy to learn and use, with clear and intuitive syntax.
2. **Fundamental Concepts**: Incorporate essential concepts such as:
   - Variables and basic data types
   - Control structures (if/else, loops)
   - Functions and procedures
   - Arithmetic and logical operations
   - String and list manipulation

3. **Applicability**: The language will focus on:
   - Basic mathematical calculations
   - List and string manipulation
   - Solving simple everyday problems

4. **Educational**: Serve as an educational tool to:
   - Demonstrate compilation/interpretation concepts
   - Show how programming languages work internally
   - Facilitate learning of fundamental programming concepts

## Use Cases

The language will be particularly useful for:

- Solving simple mathematical problems
- Manipulating and processing data lists
- Creating small scripts for basic task automation
- Demonstrating programming concepts in a controlled environment

## Benefits

- Smooth learning curve
- Focus on fundamental concepts
- Ideal environment for experimentation and learning
- Solid foundation for transitioning to more complex languages
